# About Me

Welcome to my blog! I am a lifelong learner, a technological polyglot, and a problem solver. I juggle the roles of Computational Scientist, Software Engineer, and Solutions Architect at an Energy MegaCorp. I spend most of my creative energy developing automation and decision support software that enable faster and better decision making through optimization and machine learning.

I have about 15 years of programming experience with an arsenal of tools, platforms, languages and frameworks that includes[^footnote]:

- Python: Django Rest Framework, Pandas, Dash
- C++
- Microsoft Azure
- Docker
- Angular
- Asp.Net Core
- OpenShift Container Platform
- Kubernetes

[^footnote]: In approximately descending order of expertise

I started my DevOps journey about 4 years ago and am a big proponent of the DevOps culture and Agile methodology in the cross-disciplinary teams I lead. I learn by doing, and a lot my knowledge in areas including software architecture, DevOps, and data science was acquired through practical experience. My goal with this blog is to share that knowledge by writing technical articles on these subjects, with an emphasis on real-world applications.
